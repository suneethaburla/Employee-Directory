# Employee Directory

This web application, built in React, allows the user to view non-sensitive information such as headshot, email, phone number and date of birth, about an employee. The user will be able to sort the users by specific categories clciking on the header of the column.

## User Story

* As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

## Business Context

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

Here is the link to the deployed application.
